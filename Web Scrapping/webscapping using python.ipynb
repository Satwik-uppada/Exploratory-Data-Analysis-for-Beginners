      "Log InADRoyal Enfield BikesRoyal Enfield bike price starts from Rs. 1,49,900. Royal Enfield offers 9 new models in India with most popular bikes being Hunter 350, Bullet 350 and Classic 350. The upcoming bikes of Royal Enfield include Bullet 350 Next Gen, Himalayan 450 and Shotgun 650. Most expensive Royal Enfield bike is Super Meteor 650, which is priced at Rs. 3,54,398.Royal Enfield is one of the oldest surviving motorcycle manufacturers in the world. Established in 1901, the iconic British manufacturer started off by manufacturing motorcycles, bicycles, lawnmowers, stationary engines and more popularly, weapons. To this day, Royal Enfield continues to use the motto ‘Made like a gun’, in memory of its legacy. Royal Enfield bikes are known for the class they exude as much as for their signature thump. Royal Enfield was acquired by Eicher Motors in 1994, which proved to be a pivotal role in the resurgence of the manufacturer. Although the company continues to make classic-styled and old-school motorcycles which are essentially modernised versions of the early Bullet models from the 1950s, the fortunes of Royal Enfield have turned and it is one of the fastest growing bike makers in the country. However, while the Classic set the company on a path of unprecedented growth, a few Royal Enfield models like the now-discontinued single-cylinder Continental GT had to make do with a muted response. The Royal Enfield in India, was unchallenged, until the foray of International brands like Triumph and Indian Chief. Making the most of its image as a lifestyle motorcycle manufacturer, Royal Enfield has so far managed to hold its turf despite a line-up in which some models are outdated. Having established its foothold in the Indian market, Royal Enfield is now aiming at widening its footprint at a global level. Of late, the company has been making its presence felt on a global scale by setting up exclusive dealerships in Europe, Gulf and the US. The Royal Enfield portfolio currently comprises of the Bullet, Classic, Thunderbird, Himalayan, Interceptor 650 and Continental GT 650. Of these, the Bullet, Classic and Thunderbird are available in two versions powered by 350cc and 500cc engines. While all the models have stayed true to the company’s traditional character, a few specific models do get their share of modern tech in the form of fuel injection, projector headlamp and digital instrument cluster. ABS and a rear disc brake have recently been added to this list for the entire range. Things are expected to get a lot more exciting for the brand presently, with the launch of its first twin-cylinder motorcycles, the Interceptor 650 and Continental GT 650. These are twin-cylinder 650cc motorcycles that promise to bring in a new chapter for the brand not just in India, but globally too, with their aggressive pricing.Royal Enfield Bikes Price List (August 2023) in IndiaRoyal Enfield Bike ModelOn-Road PricesRoyal Enfield Hunter 350₹ 1,49,900  *Royal Enfield Bullet 350₹ 1,50,894  *Royal Enfield Classic 350₹ 1,93,080  *Royal Enfield Continental GT 650₹ 3,18,417  *Royal Enfield Meteor 350₹ 2,04,114  *Royal Enfield Himalayan₹ 2,15,881  *Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650₹ 3,54,398  *Royal Enfield Interceptor 650₹ 3,02,418  *Royal Enfield Scram 411₹ 2,06,234  **Is Avg.

It's known for its vintage design, strong build quality, and a relaxed cruising experience. Here are some aspects of the bike that riders often praise\n",
      "1.Classic Design: The Classic 350 is reminiscent of classic British motorcycles from the mid-20th century. It features a timeless and elegant design, which appeals to riders who appreciate the retro look.\n",
      "2Comfortable Cruising: It  is designed with a comfortable riding position, making it well-suited for long rides and highway cruising. The upright posture and well-padded seat contribute to a relaxed and enjoyable riding experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.Torquey Engine: The Classic 350 is powered by a single-cylinder engine with decent low-end torque. It may not be the most powerful bike in its class, but the torquey nature of the engine provides good pull in city traffic and while riding at moderate speeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thumping Sound: Enthusiasts appreciate the distinct \"thump\" sound produced by the Classic 350's engine. It adds to the nostalgic appeal and is one of the characteristics that set Royal Enfield motorcycles apart from others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aftermarket Customization: The Classic 350 has a massive aftermarket support, allowing owners to personalize their bikes with various accessories and modifications. This flexibility to customize makes it a favorite among motorcycle enthusiasts.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, like any motorcycle, the Classic 350 may have some downsides as well, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "Vibrations: Some riders have reported vibrations, especially at higher speeds, which can be a bit discomforting on long rides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weight: The Classic 350 is a heavy motorcycle, which can make it a bit challenging to handle in tight traffic or parking situations.\n",
      "\n",

As an avid rider, I've had the pleasure of owning and riding the Classic 350 for the past year, and I must say, it has left a lasting impression. In this review, I'll share my thoughts and experiences with this iconic machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Design and Aesthetics:\n",
      "The Classic 350's design is a perfect blend of old-school charm and modern-day convenience. The classic lines, round headlamps, and chrome accents exude a retro appeal that is both elegant and captivating. The bike's muscular stance and well-crafted fuel tank add to its visual allure. Moreover, the Classic 350 comes in a range of vibrant colour options, giving riders the opportunity to express their individuality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Performance and Ride Quality:\n",
      "With a 346cc air-cooled engine at its heart, the Classic 350 provides a pleasurable riding experience. The thumping exhaust note, synonymous with Royal Enfield, adds to the bike's character and never fails to turn heads. The engine delivers a respectable amount of torque, making city commuting a breeze. However, on open highways, it tends to lack a bit in terms of top-end power, and long rides at high speeds can be a bit straining. Nonetheless, the bike's low and mid-range performance is commendable, and it's perfect for cruising around town or scenic countryside rides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Handling and Comfort:\n",
      "The Classic 350's handling is sturdy and confidence-inspiring. The bike's comfortable upright seating position, along with well-designed handlebars, ensures a relaxed and fatigue-free ride even on extended journeys. The suspension setup does a decent job of soaking up minor bumps, though it could feel a bit harsh over rough terrains. The wide and well-cushioned seat offers ample room for both the rider and pillion, making it an ideal companion for long rides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Build Quality and Reliability:\n",
      "Royal Enfield has made significant improvements in the build quality of their bikes over the years, and the Classic 350 is no exception. The fit and finish are impressive, and the materials used feel robust and durable. Regular maintenance and proper care can ensure the bike's longevity and reliability. However, occasional issues like oil leaks and electrical gremlins have been reported by some owners, though these seem to be isolated cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fuel Efficiency:\n",
      "Given its engine capacity and the raw power it offers, the Classic 350's fuel efficiency is decent. Riders can expect around 35-40 km/l in city riding conditions and slightly better mileage on highways. While it may not be the most fuel-efficient bike in its class, the Classic 350 compensates with its timeless appeal and nostalgic experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "In conclusion, the Royal Enfield Classic 350 is a motorcycling legend that manages to blend nostalgic charm with modern conveniences. Its classic design, thumping exhaust note, and comfortable ride make it a popular choice among enthusiasts and commuters alike. While it may not be the most performance-driven bike in its category, it's undeniable charisma and robust build quality make it a worthwhile investment for those seeking an authentic motorcycling experience.
