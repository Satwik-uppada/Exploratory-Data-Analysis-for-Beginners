    "##  Covariance\n",
    "Covariance is a statistical measure that quantifies the degree to which two random variables change together. It indicates whether two variables tend to increase or decrease at the same time. If the covariance is positive, it suggests that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well. If the covariance is negative, it indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. A covariance of zero suggests that there is no linear relationship between the two variables."
